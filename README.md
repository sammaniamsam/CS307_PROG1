# Sensor-Reading-Simulation
Environmental sensors are essential to measuring pollutants in the air, water, and earth. But, replacing sensors can be a difficult task. So, a software testbed has been devised. The goal is to test sensors, which are like the sensors that will be integrated, and make sure they function properly with the existing system. To accomplish seamless integration, simulation software is being used to model the process by which a sensor reads and generates data, a sensor mount routes data, and a display device presents data
